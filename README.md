# SetupOpenCVinRaspPi
Step by step to setup, compile, and check build information of Open CV in Raspberry Pi.

In this setup I use OpenCV 3.1.0, you can select different version or latest version but the process remains the same.

Process need to be done:
   1. Installing dependencies / necessary packages
   2. Downloading of OpenCV source-code
   3. Compile OpenCV source-code
   4. Install compiled OpenCV library
   5. Get OpenCV build information (verify)
